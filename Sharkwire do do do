Downloaded the file but could not open it
Opened the file with wireshark
Looked through all the source
Looked at conversations and we find an IP adress 
Filtered out everything related to that IP adress using ip.addr
went to conversations and filtered again
A particular GET statement is what we needed , GET means an HTTP request is being sent
Followed that GET
Found a flag and it looked encrypted in rot13
Used online rot13 decoder
