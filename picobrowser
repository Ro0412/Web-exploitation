Opened the link
Tried to click on flag but it said you are not picobrowser
HInt said that no new browser had to be installed
Went to souce code and tried to read it through but did not find anything
Went to inspections and storage but did not find anything
Went to network and in the file named flag saw the information given like gzip was the encoding and the User-Agent was Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0
So downloaded Modify Header extension for firefox and changed User-Agent to picobrowser
Got the flag
