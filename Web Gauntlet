Opened both the links
Round 1
Entered admin as username and password but it showed invalid
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin'was displayed
So I tried to terminate after username by doing putting username as admin';-- so the rest becomes a comment

Round 2
On the filters page ,now it said or and like= --
So I removed -- from the previous username

Round 3
 or and = like > < --
 These were the filters for round 3
 But I did not use any of this in my last username so I used the same admin';
 
 Round 4
  or and = like > < -- admin
  These were the filters for round 4
  So now i cannot use admin word
  So I used adm'||'in'
  
Round 5
union statement was filtered but I did not use it(read more about union)
Used same username as last
