Downloaded the file and tried to open it but it showed file format not supported
Downloaded Bless Hex editor
Opened it and saw that file type is BITMAP BM in decoded side
changed file type to .bmp
It still doesn't work
So I compared it to actual bmp file using hxd
Header had BA DD two times 
I changed it according to the sample bmp file I downloaded
A got an image which said flas not found
Figured out what source code controls size and resolution
Downloaded libimage-exiftool-perl to use exiftool
1134*306 were the dimesnsion
used online python compiler to change integer to hexdecimal
editor reads the bytes in reverse
changed the width to 850 so image zoomed out and got the flag
